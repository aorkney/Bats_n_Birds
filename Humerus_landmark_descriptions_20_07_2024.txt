[[1]] "Humerus_Deepest_recession_lateral_condyle"

>> The deepest point of the central recession on the distal lateral condyle of the humerus
This could conservatively be considered a type 2 landmark under Bookstein's topology, because it is a local minimum
and not a suture, but it represents the site of attachment for lateral muscles of wrist and digit extension 

[[2]] "Humerus_Posterior_synthesis_lateral_condyle_diaphysis"

>> The point of inflection where the lateral condyle fuses of the distal humerus fuses with the caudal aspect of the 
diaphysis. 
This is a local gradient change and therefore represents a type 2 landmark under Bookstein's topology

[[3]] "Humerus_Posterior_proximal_position_lateral_condyle"

>> The lateral condyle of the distal humerus forms a lip that pinches together in a horse-shoe shape. This represents the termination of the caudal 
arm of the horseshoe. 
This is a local osteological feature conservatively considered a type 2 landmark. 

[[4]] "Humerus_Anterior_synthesis_lateral_condyle_diaphysis_capitulum"

>> The lateral condyle of the distal humerus and the capitulum of the distal humerus meet at a local minimum. 
It is likely this represents the point of fusion of distinct ossification centres in the distal humeral 
epiphysis, and could therefore be considered type 1. 

[[5]] "Humerus_Proximal_point_supratrochlear_fossa"

>> Rarely if ever perforate, this feature represents the proximal most point of the articular capsule with the ulna, 
and is therefore a type 1 landmark describing a tissue juncture. 

[[6]] "Humerus_Synthesis_supratrochlear_fossa_trochlea"

>> The medial lip of the supratrochlear fossa meets the medial aspect of the trochlea at this point. 
Conservatively type 2, but a case for type 1 could be made if this is the fusion zone of distinct ossification centres. 
Represents the transition to the trochlear surface with the ulna. 

[[7]] "Humerus_Prominence_spina_entepicondyli"

>> The medial epicondyle of the humerus of bats often projects to form an elaborate structure, which presumably serves
as a point of attachment for the medial suite of wrist and digit extension muscles. 
This structure is variable and I therefore marked its distal most point; it should be considered type 3. 

[[8]] "Humerus_Posterior_synthesis_trochlea_diaphsysis"

>> The caudal aspect of the distal humerus where the trochlea surface with the ulna fuses to the diaphysis, 
likely represents an ossification centre fusion. Defensibly type 1, conservatively type 2. 

[[9]] "Humerus_Anteriorproximal_prominence_lateral_condyle" 

>> The opposite side to the horseshoe formed with Humerus_Posterior_proximal_position_lateral_condyle,
type 2 landmark. 

[[10]] "Humerus_Tuberculum_minus" 

>> The lesser tubercle of the lateral aspect of the proximal humerus, likely serves as attachment for subscapularis, 
ergo tissue juncture so type 1 classification. 

[[11]] "Humerus_Synthesis_medial_crest_diaphysis" 

>> The point of inflection between the diaphysis and the medial supracondylar crest. 
Often difficult to identify, so should be considered a type 2 landmark. 

[[12]] "Humerus_Deepest_recession_proximal_head" 

>> The deepest point of the articular capsule, facing proximally and perpendicular to the glenoid. 
Local minimum, ergo type 2, may represent the midpoint for proximal epiphyseal ossification centres. 

[[13]] "Humerus_Proximal_end_medial_pectoral_ridge" 

>> One proximal point which begins the deltopectoral crest, which is usually a broad crest with two distinct edges in bats,
fusing at their distal extension before meeting the diaphysis. This landmark denotes the medial edge of this feature and is a type 1 landmark defined by the juncture of the 
deltoideus, pectoral musculature and humerus.

[[14]] "Humerus_Proximal_end_lateral_pectoral_ridge" 

>> The second proximal point which begins the deltopectoral crest. This landmark denotes the lateral edge of this feature and is a type 1 landmark defined by the juncture of the 
deltoideus, pectoral musculature and humerus.

[[15]] "Humerus_Distal_end_lateral_pectoral_ridge" 

>> Distal termination of the deltopectoral crest. Type 1.

[[16]] "Humerus_Proximal_recession_tuberculum_majus" 

>> A local recession on the proximally facing aspect of the greater tubercle; type 2. 

[[17]] "Humerus_Lateral_recession_tuberculum_majus" 

>> A local recession on the laterally facing aspect of the greater tubercle; type 2. 

[[18]] "Humerus_Distalmost_sulcus_head_tuberculum_minus" 

>> The point where the lesser tubercle of the humerus meets the neck of the glenoid, which are essentially confluent with the glenoid in bats.
Type 2, arguably type 1 because I suspect these features originate from distinct ossification centres. 

[[19]] "Humerus_Distalmost_sulcus_head_tuberculum_majus" 

>> The point where the greater tubercle of the humerus meets the neck of the glenoid, which are essentially confluent with the glenoid in bats.
Type 2, arguably type 1 because I suspect these features originate from distinct ossification centres.
