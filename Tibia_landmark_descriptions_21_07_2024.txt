[1] "Tibia_Proximal_tuberosity"    

>> This is the patella-aligned proximal tuberosity of the tibia, facing caudally in bats but cranially in other mammals. Type 2. 
          
[2] "Tibia_Medial_condyle"

>> This is the medially facing condyle of the proximal tibia surface articulating the femur, faces medially in bats but laterally in other mammals. Type 2. 
                    
[3] "Tibia_Lateral_condyle"  

>> This is the laterally facing condyle of the proximal tibia surface articulating the femur, faces laterally in bats but medially in other mammals. Type 2. 
                 
[4] "Tibia_Distal_align_tuberosity"   

>> Distal most point of the Tibia, aligned with ridge extending down the diaphysis towards the patella. Type 3. 
        
[5] "Tibia_Curve_tuberosity_medial"    

>> Semilandmark curve around proximal articulation with femur between Tibia_Proximal_tuberosity and Tibia_Medial_condyle
       
[6] "Tibia_Curve_proximal_medial_lateral"  

>> Semilandmark curve around proximal articulation with femur between Tibia_Medial_condyle and Tibia_Lateral_condyle
   
[7] "Tibia_Curve_proximal_lateral_tuberosity"

>> Semilandmark curve around proximal articulation with femur between Tibia_Lateral_condyle and Tibia_Proximal_tuberosity
 
[8] "Tibia_Curve_diaphysis"

>> Semilandmark curve extending along diaphysis of tibia between Tibia_Proximal_tuberosity and Tibia_Distal_align_tuberosity, often demarcated by a sharp ridge, presumably dividing
distal leg muscle compartments.
