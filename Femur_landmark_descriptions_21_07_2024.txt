[1] "Femur_Greater_trochanter" 

>> The proximal apex of the greater trochanter of the proximal femur. Faces medially in bats because of rotation of femur to orient patella caudally. 
Type 2 landmark; local maximum. 
              
 [2] "Femur_Lesser_trochanter"  

>> The proximal apex of the lesser trochanter of the proximal femur. Opposed to the greater trochanter. 
                       
 [3] "Femur_Fovea_proximal_head"  

>> The footprint of the femoral tendon to the acetabular surface of the pelvis. Type 1
                 
 [4] "Femur_trochanteric_fossa"      

>> Cranially facing distal minimum of Y-shaped fossa between trochanters. Type 2
                  
 [5] "Femur_Sulcus_greater_trochanter_head"     

>> Point of sythesis between greater trochanteric surface and the lip of the femoral head. Type 1; suspect fusion of distinct ossification centres. 

 [6] "Femur_Sulcus_lesser_trochanter_head" 

>> Point of sythesis between lesser trochanteric surface and the lip of the femoral head. Type 1; suspect fusion of distinct ossification centres. 
            
 [7] "Femur_Sulcus_trochanteric_fossa_head"       

>> The point at the cranial proximal aspect of the femur where the fossa between trochanters smoothly meets the femoral head. Type 2.
     
 [8] "Femur_Synthesis_Proximal_ridge_diaphysis"       

>> Distal end of muscle attachment crest extending from lesser trochanter along diaphysis. 
Suspect that this ridge situates the site of attachment of numerous obturator and gemellus muscles involved in hip rotation; probably medial rotation. Type 1. 
 
 [9] "Femur_Deepest_recession_lateral_condyle"    
   
>> Homologous to midpoint of medial condyle in most mammals. This is on the same side as the lesser trochanter. Distal femur. Probably location of colateral ligament. Type 1.

[10] "Femur_Proximal_terminus_lateral_condyle"  

>> The femur faces backwards in bats, and this is therefore homologous to the medially located caudally facing synthesis with the diaphysis of the medial condylar ridge of the distal femur. 
Type 2. 
       
[11] "Femur_Interior_proximal_terminus_lateral_condyle"

>> Move medially from Femur_Proximal_terminus_lateral_condyle to find termination of condylar synthesis. Type 2. 

[12] "Femur_Sulcus_condyles" 

>> Distal union of the trough between the two condyles of the distal femur. Type 1, because I think these condyles originate from distinct ossification centres. 
                          
[13] "Femur_Interior_proximal_terminus_medial_condyle" 

>> Opposing Femur_Interior_proximal_terminus_lateral_condyle, type 2.

>> Opposing Femur_Proximal_terminus_lateral_condyle, type 2. 

[15] "Femur_Proximal_terminus_medial_condylar_ridge" 

>> The condylar ridge synthesis with the diaphysis, faces caudally; follow the medial condylar ridge to find. Type 1. 
  
[16] "Femur_Proximal_terminus_lateral_condylar_ridge"  

>> The condylar ridge synthesis with the diaphysis, faces caudally; follow the lateral condylar ridge to find. Type 1. 

[17] "Femur_Proximal_ridge_curve"     

>> Semilandmark curve tracing insertion of obturator and gemmelus muscles of medial rotation upon the lesser trochanter; extends from 
Femur_Lesser_trochanter to Femur_Synthesis_Proximal_ridge_diaphysis
