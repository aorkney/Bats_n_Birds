[1] "Radius_Facet_humerus_capitulum"

>> The landmark at the deepest recession of the proximal joint capsule of the radius, recieving the capitulum of the humerus. 
Type 2 landmark by Bookstein's topology because it is a local minimum. 

[2] "Radius_Caudal_apex_facet_humerus"

>> The apex of a caudally projecting lip around the proximal articular surface of the radius, confluent with the surface
receiving the humeral capitulum. Type 2 landmark, potentially type 1 because this may be a suture of multiple ossification centres
within the proximal epiphyseal radius.

[4] "Radius_Cranial_synthesis_facet_capitulum_lateral"

>> The cranial synthesis between the capitulum surface and a ridge defining a laterally projecting lip of the proximal radius towards its common articulation with the
humerus and ulna. Type 1 landmark under Bookstein's topology because it is an articulation zone where multiple bones meet. 

[5] "Radius_Apex_flange_biceps_groove"

ambiguous whether Type 1 or 2.

Most ventral distal projection of articular surface of radius with carpal bones; Type 3.
